description: "The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves, a novel by Tobias\
  \ Smollett, was published in 1760 in the monthly paper The British Magazine. Its\
  \ first number, published in January, 1760, contained the first installment of Smollettâ€™s\
  \ fourth novel. The novel, Smollett's shortest, differs stylistically from his previous\
  \ works.\nSir Launcelot is virtuous and strange, and he is surrounded by a Smollettian\
  \ menagerie whose various jargons are part of this novel's linguistic virtuosity\
  \ and satire. He is an eighteenth-century gentleman who rides about the country\
  \ in armour, attended by his comic squire, Timothy Crabshaw, redressing grievances.\
  \ These characters are obviously inspired by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and Smollett's\
  \ novel has been compared unfavorably with Cervantes'.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
